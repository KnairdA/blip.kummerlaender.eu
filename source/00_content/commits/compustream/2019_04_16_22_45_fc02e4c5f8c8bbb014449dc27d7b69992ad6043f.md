# Add basic physical scaling and Knudsen quality criterion

The paper [Automatic grid refinement criterion for lattice Boltzmann method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06767) by Lagrava et al. describes a criterion for measuring the local simulation quality using a comparison of the theoretical Knudsen number and the quotient of the cells's non-equilibrium and equilibrium function.

While this criterion was developed to enable automatic selection of areas to be refined, it also offers a interesting and unique perspective on the fluid structure.

As the criterion requires calculation of the modeled Reynolds-, Mach- and Knudsen-numbers I took the time to set up the basics for scaling the simulation to actually model a physical system. Or rather calculating which physical model is represented by the chosen resolution and relaxation time.
