# Compustream performance improvements and interactive wall drawing

I found some time to further develop my GLSL compute shader based interactive LBM fluid simulation previously described in [_Fun with compute shaders and fluid dynamics_](https://blog.kummerlaender.eu/article/fun_with_compute_shaders_and_fluid_dynamics). Not only is it now possible to interactively draw bounce back walls into the running simulation but performance was greatly improved by one tiny line:

	glfwSwapInterval(0);

If this function is not called during GLFW window initialization the whole rendering loop is capped to 60 FPS -- including compute shader dispatching. This embarrassing oversight on my part caused the simulation to run way slower than possible.
