# Describe custom gitolite and cgit setup

Replaces short-term Gitea instance on `code.kummerlaender.eu`.

The main reason for implementing this more complex setup is that Gitea
both lacks in features in areas that I care about and provides distracting
features in other areas that I do not use.

e.g. Gitea provides multi-user, discussion and organization support but doesn't provide
Atom feeds which are required for [Overview](https://tree.kummerlaender.eu/projects/xslt/overview/).

This is why exposing [gitolite](http://gitolite.com)-managed repositories
via [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/) is a better fit for my usecases.

Note that gitolite is further configured outside of Nix through its own admin repository.

As a side benefit `pkgs.kummerlaender.eu` now provides further archive
formats of its Nix expressions which simplifies Nix channel usage.
