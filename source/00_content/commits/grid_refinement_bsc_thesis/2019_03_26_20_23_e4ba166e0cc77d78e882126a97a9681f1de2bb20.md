# Published my BSc thesis on grid refined LBM in OpenLB

In addition to the [PDF](https://static.kummerlaender.eu/media/gitterverfeinerte_lbm_in_openlb.pdf) (German, ~60 pages) all sources including any referenced simulation data are available on [Github](https://github.com/KnairdA/grid_refinement_bsc_thesis/) and [cgit](https://code.kummerlaender.eu/grid_refinement_bsc_thesis). The resulting actual implementation of the grid refinement method by [Lagrava et al.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2222180) in [OpenLB](https://www.openlb.net/) is currently not available publicly and likely wont make it into the next release. Nevertheless -- if you are interested in the code and I have not yet found the time to release a rebased patch for the latest OpenLB release don't hesitate to [contact me](https://tree.kummerlaender.eu/contact).

As a side note: The gnuplot-based [setup](https://code.kummerlaender.eu/grid_refinement_bsc_thesis/tree/img/common) for efficiently transforming [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) CSV exports into plots such as the one above (i.e. plots that are neither misaligned Paraview screenshots nor overlarge PDF-reader-crashing PGFPlots figures) might be of interest even if one doesn't care about grid refinement or Lattice Boltzmann Methods (which would be sad but to each their own :-)).
