# Nixify build process

Building the website in the presence of the Nix package manager is now
as simple as:

- cloning this repo
- entering the nix-shell environment declared by `shell.nix`
- calling `generate`
- optionally call `preview` to spawn a webserver in `target/99_result`

All dependencies such as the internal InputXSLT, StaticXSLT and
BuildXSLT modules as well as external ones such as KaTeX and pandoc are
built declaratively by Nix.
