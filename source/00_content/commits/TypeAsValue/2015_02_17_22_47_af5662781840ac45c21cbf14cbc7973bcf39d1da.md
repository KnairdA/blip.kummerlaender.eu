# Reimplemented `TakeWhile` and `DropWhile` in terms of `ListIndex`

* new higher order list operation `ListIndex` returns the index of the first list element satisfying a given predicate function
	* this enables finding the split index required for both `TakeWhile` and `DropWhile`
	* actual list manipulation is then performed using lower order `Take` or `Drop`
	* analogously to `list-index` in SRFI-1
	* added appropriate test case
* added higher order predicate utility function `utility::predicate_assurance`
	* as its name implies this function enables assuring that a value satisfies a given predicate
		* if this is not the case a surrogate value is returned instead
	* this is used to return a appropriate size value if the `ListIndex` call fails because no element satisfies its predicate
	* `detail::predicate_negator` was moved from `Remove`'s implementation details into the newly introduced `utility` namespace
		* as it is required by both `TakeWhile` and `DropWhile` in addition to `Remove`
* continuation of 8e49cc6
