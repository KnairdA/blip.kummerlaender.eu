# Revamped partial function application

* moved internals into separate header i.e. the `detail` namespace relating to `Apply`
* implemented automatic alias selection by implementing aliae of the basic variadic `type` template alias in different base classes
	* variadic partial application is implemented in `detail::apply_variadic`
		* `detail::apply_single` and `detail::apply_pair` define aliae to `detail::apply_variadic`'s `type` template alias
		* both restricted aliae derive from `detail::apply_variadic`
	* `Apply` derives from any of the aliae defining base classes depending on the count of placeholders as determined by `detail::coun
t_placeholders`
		* `Apply` is guaranteed to always be derived from `detail::apply_variadic` one way or the other
* changed functions, test cases and examples depending on `Apply` accordingly
	* `Length` had to be reimplemented without `Apply` as it doesn't allow usage of aliae expecting a different count of arguments anym
ore
		* this is a advantage in the sense that core functionality of _TypeAsValue_ now doesn't depend on this complex partial application
implementation anymore
		* such functionality may be reimplemented separately from `Apply`
* removed unnecessary `tav` namespace prefixes
