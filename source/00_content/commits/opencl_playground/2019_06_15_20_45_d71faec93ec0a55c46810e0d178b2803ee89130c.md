# Symbolically generate D3Q19 OpenCL kernel using SymPy

My recent experiments in using the [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) CAS library for automatically deriving optimized LBM codes have now evolved to the point where a single generator produces both D2Q9 and D3Q19 OpenCL kernels.

Automatically deriving kernel implementations from the symbolic formulation of e.g. the BGK relaxation operator presents itself as a very powerful concept. This could potentially be developed to the point where a LBM specific code generator could produce highly optimized GPU programs tailored to arbitrary simulation problems.
