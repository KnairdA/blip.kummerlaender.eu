# [Just-in-time volumetric CFD visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2al5tV14M8&list=PLRqmRhcPBBPscHlIRCMnN3vdocqoC8OLD)

For my [seminar talk](https://literatelb.org/talk/) I wrote another LBM solver as a literate Org-document using CUDA and SymPy.
The main focus was on just-in-time volumetric visualizations of the simulations performed by this code. While this is not ready
to publish yet, check out the following impressions:

Further videos are available on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-LKZPWM0S0). e.g. a Taylor-Couette flow:
