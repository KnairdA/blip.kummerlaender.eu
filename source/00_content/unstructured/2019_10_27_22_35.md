# [Started working on a framework for generating LBM kernels](https://github.com/KnairdA/boltzgen)

During the past exam season I now and then continued to play around with my GPU LBM code [symlbm_playground](https://tree.kummerlaender.eu/projects/symlbm_playground/).
While I mostly focused on generating various real-time visualizations using e.g. volumetric ray marching, the underlying principle of generating OpenCL
kernels from a symbolic description has not lost its promise.

This is why I have now started to extract the generator part of this past project into a more general framework.
Currently [boltzgen](https://code.kummerlaender.eu/boltzgen/about/) targets C++ and OpenCL using a shared symbolic description while providing various configuration options:

```sh
λ ~/p/d/boltzgen (boltzgen-env) ● ./boltzgen.py --help
usage: boltzgen.py [-h] --lattice LATTICE --layout LAYOUT --precision
                   PRECISION --geometry GEOMETRY --tau TAU [--disable-cse]
                   [--functions FUNCTIONS [FUNCTIONS ...]]
                   [--extras EXTRAS [EXTRAS ...]]
                   language

Generate LBM kernels in various languages using a symbolic description.

positional arguments:
  language              Target language (currently either "cl" or "cpp")

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --lattice LATTICE     Lattice type (D2Q9, D3Q7, D3Q19, D3Q27)
  --layout LAYOUT       Memory layout ("AOS" or "SOA")
  --precision PRECISION
                        Floating precision ("single" or "double")
  --geometry GEOMETRY   Size of the block geometry ("x:y(:z)")
  --tau TAU             BGK relaxation time
  --disable-cse         Disable common subexpression elimination
  --functions FUNCTIONS [FUNCTIONS ...]
                        Function templates to be generated
  --extras EXTRAS [EXTRAS ...]
                        Additional generator parameters
```

The goal is to build upon this foundation to provide an easy way to generate efficient code using a high level description of various collision models and boundary conditions.
This should allow for easy comparision between various streaming patterns and memory layouts.
